## Lesson Outline.

- Difference between shared and dedicated hosts. 
- Managed services and On-demand services. 
- Networking 
- Elasticity and Scalability. 
- Securty. 
- Virtualisation.

## Charactersitcs of Cloud Computing. 

- Havening the availability of resources without.
- Basically multyple instances that can be easliey scaled up and down. 

### on the site
- Managed services are operated and maintained by the cloud provider on your behalf

- On-Demand Services are available to use and release instantly; only pay for what you use

- Virtual Private Clouds allows network customization with grater security and isolation

- Scalability & Elasticity refer to the ability of your cloud resources to grow or shrink on-demand

- Security includes both network security and access management. 

## Virtualization. 

- allowes multyple OS's run on a single machine. 
- Hypervisor allows multiple. it is the core component and makes a VM aka a GuestOS. 
- All-though they are using the same resources they are isolated from one another. 

Host machine -> Hypervisor -> Create(Virtual Machine) -> Which runs apps.

- short process bad idea
    - Idel too long and well its obvious. 

- If you have too many process as well bad idea. 

# Well this is also done.. Kinda sad still did not get to code.
